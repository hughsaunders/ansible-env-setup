# ansible-env-setup
Playbooks for dev environment setup

These roles install and configure vim, tmux and powerline to my liking. 

The only variable that really needs to be set is target_user so the per-user configs are dropped in the right place.
Additional vim plugins should be added in roles/vim/defaults
